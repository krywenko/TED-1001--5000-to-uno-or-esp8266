# TED-1001--5000-to-uno-or-esp8266

here is a method to convert a a ted 5000 MTU into a network monitor via either esp8266 or Arduino or display directly on LCD.
it only requirs to wires  a ground wire and a  serial pin wire then connect it to the rX of your arduino/esp to be network connected.

there are other files related to TED 1001 and the ted display module  to capture  and store info directly to computer  it also contains various Pl and sh to data  store to RRD and graphing to webpages .   also included is one of my original GTI limiter based on  data grabed from  TED MTU module
